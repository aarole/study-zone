Study Zone offers a centralized way to access 4 features - 

1. Todo List
2. Statistics
3. Reminders
4. Spotify playlists curated for studying

According to us, these are the core requirements that students look for when it comes to study-related applications, and we
wanted to provide a centralized way to access said features.

Study Zone can be downloaded from the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.aarole.study_zone">Google Play Store</a>.
